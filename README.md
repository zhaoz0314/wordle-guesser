The guessing.py script makes the guesses based on the entropies.  (The current version is for the ordinary algorithm.   For the minimax version, simply change the averageEntropy function to a function that takes the maximum entropy.)  The wordle.py is a wordle game I wrote to test guessing.py.  When running, all files should be in the same folder.

I guess the only detail worth mentioning in writing the two scripts is, that when finding the entropy reduction/remaining entropy for each cue, one can 1) either range over all possible cues, where for each cue, find all possible answers consistent with this cue and calculate the remaining entropy, 2) or range over all possible answers, where for each answer, assign it to a cue, and finally calculate all remaining entropies for all cues at the end.  Method 1) was more straightforward to me, and I initially coded guessing.py in that way.  But apparently method 1) is much less efficient, since in this case all possible answers are scanned through 3^5 times, making the code run forever.  After switching to method 2), the initial guess only took 2 mins for the longest word list and would take much shorter for the two other lists.  I think this is what he meant during the meeting when he said if we loop over wrong things we will  introduce a 10^2 factor and make the code not runnable.
